					<span>I live in Western Sonoma County, in the town of Occidental</span>
					<span>and kind of near the coast up in the Redwood country, some know it as wine country.</span>
					<span>I'm a biologist by birth, one of those characters that chase the creepy-crawlies around</span>
					<span>since I came out of the womb, and ultimately that's led me to water because ultimately</span>
					<span class="current">the recognition that the hydrologic integrity of any</span> <span class="current">ecosystem, if it has an imbalance,</span>
					<span>then the capacity to support life in that system will be always compromised.</span>
				<p>
				<p>
					<span>And so tonight, a little bit of what we want to talk about or what we were asked to talk about</span>
					<span>is the wisdom of the watershed, and so then we've gotta engage with the anthropomophization</span>
					<span>of what is a watershed and all of that, and so I wanna dive right into this and I just</span>
					<span>put together a series of images and slides about water primarily and then we'll get into</span>
					<span>watersheds and different kinds of things that we can do to engage with or, as you might say, "think like a watershed."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So many of you may know this is planet earth here, right? But ultimately as we really know, it's planet</span> 
					<span>water. And why is that it's because 70% of the surface area is water.</span>
					<span>It's 70% saline solution actually. Very similar to the amount of saline solution each of you</span>
					<span>has in your body right now. So you're a bunch of bipedal bags of saline solution.</span>
